**Day 1:**
* .tar file is an archive (like .zip) which bundles multiple files into one. Does not compress them.
* .gz means GZIP compressed files
* GitHub is not optimized for large datasets (it will crash since it has a limit of 100MB/file).
    * use .gitignore to only track changes to code, not data.
* ls -a reveals hidden files
    * touch .gitignore creates a new empty file 


WHERE YOU LEFT OFF: stage and commit and push oNLY your .gitignore first -- you have to make a new repo, deleted old one - refer to chat
